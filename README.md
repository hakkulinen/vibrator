# vibrator
a little arduino script to operate a transistor that controls the input to an electromagnet and modulates the signal it gives by reading from some buttons
not really anything special, just wanted to start keeping my work in some place that won't get deleted by me clicking random buttons like an idiot

the code has a little bruteforce math magic to make the increase/decrease of the addition/subtraction of the delay value smoother
